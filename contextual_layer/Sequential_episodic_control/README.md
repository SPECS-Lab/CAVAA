# Sequential Episodic Control (SEC)

Responsible: Ismael T. Freire (ismael.freire@donders.ru.nl, ismaeltito.freire@gmail.com)

Sequential Episodic Control (SEC) model leverages the sequential nature of episodic memory for direct control. SEC is composed of a short-term memory buffer (STM) and a long-term episodic memory (LTM), combined with an action selection algorithm. The model receives as input a compressed representation of the visual input coming from the adaptive layer and outputs control actions based on its acquired memory content.
The model is build upon [Freire, I. T., Amil, A. F., & Verschure, P. F. (2021). Sequential Episodic Control. arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.14734](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14734).
