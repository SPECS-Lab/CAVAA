# Hypothalamus model

In the hypothalamus.py script you will find two versions of the hypothalamus model.

- The **Multiattractor** class allows to implement a variable number of internal needs in the agent. Being the number of modeled needs equal to the number of inputs received. This version was presented at the IROS 2023 workshop Learning robot super autonomy (Detroit, USA).

- The **Attractor** class is a simplified version that allows to implement two internal needs in the agent. This version was published as [Guerrrero Rosado, O., Amil, A. F., Freire, I.
